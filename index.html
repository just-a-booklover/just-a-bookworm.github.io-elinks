        <p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rana_lettrice/"> Instagram</a>; until May 2020 I used to recommend books on Instagram: I posted a photo of the book and the recommendation in mi @rana_lettrice account. I don't use the account anymore (and I used to write in Italian ,:) ) but if you want to see my photos...<br><br>
       <a href="https://tellonym.me/ranalettrice">Tellonym</a>; where you can ask me questions, tell me what you think about this website or what I should improve. You can also suggest me some good books or topics for the column.<br><br>
       <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/rana_lettrice">Goodreads</a>; I just downloaded it, but it seems to be interesting and useful. I'd like to track the books I read, vote them and write recommendations of the English books I read.<br><br><p>
       <p id="psmall" style="font-size: 20px;">I don't have other ideas of links I could add. If you have any, let me know at the Tellonym link.</p>
